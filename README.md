Hi there! Myself I'm Deeshvarar shortly as Deeshva.

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciience 
at Rathinam Technical campus,Coimbatore.

I have passion in Technology and it's field that's why I have chosen this course. 
when it comes to technology I'm curious to learn new things. I had done some certification couurses,Further I will do more. I had participated in Guinness world record event "AI FOR INDIA",did mini project of "Face recognition app".It was a wonderful experience for me. 

In future I would like to create new products that will give solution to the problem facing by people.so I'm sowing seeds for that now. I like to give my contribution to this world and what my thought is technology should be in every hands of the people that cause no harm to anyone. In my view technologies should be useful for humans and a tool which they can't do, not to become as lazy or destroy them.
